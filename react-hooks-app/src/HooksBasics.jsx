                <p className='p'>ReactJS Hooks are one of the most powerful features of React, introduced in version 16.8. They allow developers to use state and other React features without writing a class component. Hooks simplify the code, make it more readable, and offer a more functional approach to React development. With hooks, Reactâ€™s state and lifecycle features can be used in functional components, making them much more powerful than they were before.</p>

                React Hooks are functions that allow functional components in React to manage state, handle side effects, and access other React features without needing class components. They provide a simpler and more efficient way to manage component logic.</p>
